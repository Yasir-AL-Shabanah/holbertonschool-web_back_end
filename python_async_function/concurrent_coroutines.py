Module for concurrent coroutines execution with type annotations.

concurrently and collecting their results in completion order.

    Execute multiple wait_random coroutines concurrently.

    Spawns n instances of wait_random coroutine with the specified max_delay
    and returns a list of all delays in ascending order without using sort().
    The ordering is achieved naturally by collecting results as they complete.

    Args:
        n: Number of wait_random coroutines to spawn
        max_delay: Maximum delay value passed to each wait_random coroutine

    Returns:
        List of float values representing delays in ascending order

    Example:
        >>> asyncio.run(wait_n(5, 5))
        [0.969, 1.026, 1.799, 3.641, 4.500]
